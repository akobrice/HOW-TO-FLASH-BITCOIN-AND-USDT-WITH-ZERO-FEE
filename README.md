# HOW-TO-FLASH-BITCOIN-AND-USDT-WITH-ZERO-FEE
Imagine this: You open your crypto wallet — and instantly, a fresh balance of USDT or Bitcoin appears. You can transfer it, swap it, trade it, or showcase it on any platform. It behaves just like the real thing.

But here’s the catch:  
That balance is programmed to vanish after a specific time — from 60 to 365 days — leaving no trace and no risk.

**Welcome to the revolutionary world of Flash USDT and Flash Bitcoin, the most advanced wallet simulation tools on the market.**

## What is Flash USDT?

**Flash USDT** is a programmable, self-expiring crypto asset. Designed to mimic real USDT, it reflects instantly in wallets, behaves identically on-chain, and integrates with most DeFi, DApp, and API systems — but disappears automatically after the set period.

It’s powered by a proprietary dual-engine framework:  
**FLACH USDT + USDT FLACH**

## What is Flash Bitcoin?

**Flash BTC** operates on the same principle: instantly inject a valid, traceable BTC balance into a Bitcoin wallet — usable for OTC deals, exchange credibility, or P2P testing — but engineered to expire automatically after a defined duration.

Great for wallet visibility, proof-of-assets, and temporary liquidity without putting actual coins at risk.
